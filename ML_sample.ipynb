       "['A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \\\\n\\\\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \\\\n\\\\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.',\n",

There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\\\\n\\\\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\\\\n\\\\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.\",\n",

And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there.

       " 'Here’s a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \\\\n\\\\n““>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\\\\n\\\\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you\\'re very simply wrong about this.  \\\\n\\\\n... \\\\n\\\\nregardless of the \"implementation\" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \\\\_energy is spent\\\\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this \"uptake\" is \\\\_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\\\\_ --- *in practice*, it\\'s a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it\\'s why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps I\\'ve mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it\\'s not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, \"only\" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the \"issue with entropy\" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it\\'s my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \\\\_at least\\\\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. “\\\\n\\\\n[End of your quote. If you don’t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \\\\n\\\\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \\\\n\\\\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I’m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It’s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I’ve cited?\\\\n\\\\nEdit: \\\\nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\\\\n“>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\\\\n\\\\nShow me where I\\'ve said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.”\\\\n\\\\nIn the post where you quoted me I said “[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “DAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.” I’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I’m this part where you quoted me I’m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible,” then either you’ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\\\\n\\\\nTo clarify what I meant by \"Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,\" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like \"thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile.\" It\\'s clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than \"possible\" or \"feasible\" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to \"win\" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn\\'t doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you\\'ve misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.',\n",

Binet explicitly warned against dangerous and unsupportable extrapolation of his work, such as using his tests to peg normal children and adults on a single, linear scale of immutable intelligence.

Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\\\\n\\\\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \\\\n\\\\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.\",\n",

Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \\\\nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\\\\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of \"the island of stability\" predicted that there should be \"magic numbers\" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus \"extremely\" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years. Which is still a lot more stable than their respective neighbors with half lives of some seconds. \\\\nThe hunt is not over though!

During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.\",\n",

Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\\\\n\\\\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\\\\n\\\\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\\\\n\\\\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\\\\n\\\\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection\",\n",

Those fluids flouresce under ultraviolet light (black light) because the highly conjugated molecules absorb and emit visible light. In this video it is a molecule called Luminol. It releases photons of visible light when the molecule is oxidized. So its undergoing a chemical reaction and emitting light, called chemiluminesence. Very different than fluorescence. :]\",\n",
       " 'Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \\\\n\\\\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the \"right time\", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\\\\n\\\\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\\\\n\\\\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it\\'s possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I\\'m not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.',\n",

Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping. Maybe the DEA would be reactive enough on its own without additional base to promote substitution instead of elimination? Not sure.\",\n",

       " 'here’s a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim i made above nn““the fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon the way the  was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all nnif you mean  the amount of energy required to reuptake the  from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the  into the atmosphere then youre very simply wrong about this  nn nnregardless of the implementation of the process manmade or natural it is absolutely the case that when you mix the  into the atmosphere energy is spent  and if that  is taken back energy is spent again and the amount on this uptake is necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing  in practice its a lot more   this is very straightforward thermodynamics  its why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible  nnnperhaps ive mislead you by letting out early on an air that this relation between the energies is somehow  when its not  for example when you burn a log depending on your furnace etc only about  of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue and is thereby a component of the issue with entropy that the fart was originally about  if i let the impression that  does then its my mistake  however the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is still such that i say confidently you would have to use at least the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back “nn nnin the above you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility it is not you now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas the blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source all that i’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the  source does not matter it seems like maybe you now agree with this claim or perhaps you agreed with it all along nnto assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost it is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency as i mentioned above the direct air capture article that i referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from  depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material it could end up being energetically worthwhile there is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile again i wonder why you are so insistent that i am wrong about this at this point i’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture and they agree with what i’m saying that carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place i read it a long time ago it’s one thing for you to say that me a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that i’ve citednnedit nalso when you said this it confused men“your initial claim that thermodynamics limits dac to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it gotnnshow me where ive said that dac is impossible instead of unfeasible or  pretty please  shut up  intentional misrepresentation is not civil”nnin the post where you quoted me i said “ claim that  dac  couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “dac is imposible instead of unfeasible” i’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response as far as i can tell i’m this part where you quoted me i’m saying that you claimed dac was unfeasible if you think that when i said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible” then either you’ve misread what i wrote or i wrote it poorly in either case i was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said i apologize if it came off like that and i’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone herennto clarify what i meant by hopefully we can both agree on this point which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits dac to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got what i was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile its clear that it is possible for people to capture  from the air since there are already plants that do this what i meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of  in the atmosphere i think that practical is likely a better word than possible or feasible or whatever else and i probably expressed what i was saying in an unclear way but i hope from context it was clear what i meantnnperhaps what i wrote expressed the sentiment that i was trying to convey poorly you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that i was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to win the argument in any discussion like this it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying and sometimes people misunderstand each other if you think that i misrepresented what you were saying i apologize again and i assure you that i wasnt doing so intentionally additionally it is a little bit ironic that i now feel that youve misrepresented me when you said that i intentionally misrepresented you',\n",
